# Hi!

I'm Kyle, an entirely self-taught software developer from Maryland, USA, with a wide set of skills and experience in software and systems, including: [TypeScript](https://github.com/kyleratti?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=typescript), HTML, CSS, [PowerShell](https://github.com/kyleratti?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=powershell), C#, [Lua](https://github.com/kyleratti?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=lua), and [Java](https://github.com/kyleratti?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java).

I also have experience working with tools and systems such as GitHub Actions, Docker, Hyper-V, VMWare, Ubuntu Server, Windows Server, and Active Directory.

Outside of [code](/programming), I love [cars](/cars), [coffee](/coffee), [photography](/photography), and my cute-as-a-button dog, [Tucker](/tucker).

### Why I Code

When I was 12, I went to a computer summer camp that ultimately changed my life forever: at the end of each day, and feeding my Star Wars obsession, we would all play [Star Wars: Jedi Knight Jedi Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Jedi_Academy). I noticed some online servers had their own modifications to the world and gameplay and had to know how. I ended up meeting the developer of one of those modifications, [@RoboPhred](https://github.com/robophred/), who has become a life-long friend and software development mentor.

It turns out that **I like knowing how stuff works**, and **I really like building stuff that others can use**; from [Reddit video mirror bots](https://github.com/kyleratti/tuckbot-downloader) and [Reddit mirror directory services](https://github.com/kyleratti/a-centralized-mirror) for the community, to [slideshow websites](https://github.com/kyleratti/ttu-slideshow) and [file relay servers](https://github.com/kyleratti/tscw-daemon) for my sister's work, and going back as far as high school, [Twitter bots](https://github.com/kyleratti/ccpsalerts-old) that tweeted county school closures and countdowns to last days of high school for classmates, I think it's the coolest thing in the world to be able to build something, watch it come to life, and see it used by others.
