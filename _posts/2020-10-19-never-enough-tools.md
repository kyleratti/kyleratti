I've owned a lot of cars over the years. Too many, frankly.

If there's one thing I've learned across the wide variety of vehicles I've owned, it's that you never have enough tools.

# Stop!

Over the weekend I (attmepted) to do brakes on my Mustang. I figured it would be pretty straightforward - after all, if I've done 4 wheel discs on a 1986 Nissan 300ZX, which features the rotors _behind_ the wheel hubs, how hard can it be to do brakes on a 2005 Ford Mustang GT?

# Threaded Caliper Pistons

For the first time in my vehicle history, I've encountered threaded brake pistons. I guess I've owned exclusively old, broken cars that never had such a concept. Vehicles employ threaded brake pistons to faciliate the parking brake mechanicism. And while my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth had the same thing, it featured a cross (`+`) design that I just used a pry-bar to retract. Well, it turns out the 2005 Mustang GT has threaded caliper pistons on the rear, and they have two "tear drop" cutouts on the outside of the piston for retracting it. More plainly, a pry-bar ain't it.

# Satan's Cube

I purchased an <a href="https://www.autozone.com/test-scan-and-specialty-tools/brake-tool/oemtools-rear-disc-brake-piston-tool/2363_0_0" target="_blank">OEMTools Rear Disc Brake Piston Tool</a> to attempt to bail me out of this misadventure. This tool seemed pretty slick - it attaches to a `3/4` ratchet and you just crank away until the piston is retracted. And it has multiple presets for multiple manufacturers - wow!

As I've learned, however, there are a few things they don't mention in the description...

## Not Compatible with 2005 Ford Mustang GT's

Yeah. None of the presets fit the 2005 Ford Mustang GT's rear caliper pistons. Not to worry, however, because I have a grinding wheel and could grind one of the presets to fit! Or so I thought...

## Compatible or Not, It's Inheritently Flawed

As someone who has strictly used C-clamps to retract pistons, I severely underestimated the amount of force and torque necessary to retract the rear caliper pistons. Like, _really severely_ underestimated the amount of force and torque. Even with my (gently modified) cube, it was impossible to get more than half of a turn on the piston before the cube slipped.

## If You Slip, You Crack Your Knuckles

Unless you've disconnected the brake caliper, you're doing this tethered to the brake line of the car. At least on a 2005 Ford Mustang GT, that means you're not able to extend past the studs on the wheel hub. That also means that if the cube slips, your knuckles smack straight into the studs.

## The Cube Is Cheap, So It'll Strip

I'll admit, the cube looks like it may be made of higher quality metal. However, I found out _very_ quickly that it's not. I stripped out my tool after ~15 attempts.

Amazing when you consider that I am far from the strongest person you'll meet!

# The Right Tool

The right tool is a proper [caliper compression tool kit](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FW3U26G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which has a ton of presets for various manufacturers, is made of high-quality metal and has an attachment tool that is designed to retract pistons with minimal effort and frustration.

Somehow, despite knowing that "The Right Tool is the Best Tool", I ended up trying to make a dumb little cube work when there's specific tool kits for this. And despite doing a handful of brake jobs before, and finally feeling like I owned a pretty decent set of tools, it's obvious that there's never enough tools. I'm beginning to think there's a conspiracy!

# Awesome Friends

I live-texted my frustrations to one of my buddies - a car guru - who put me in touch with his cousin. His cousin had the right kit and came by the next day with it. In fact, it took him ~40 minutes to do the _entire_ brake job, fronts and rears. I was approaching 2 hours on the driver's side rear caliper piston alone. Bless him.

My roommate also offered to help, which was really nice. His day job is as a mechanic, so I hate asking him for help with mechanical things after hours. He has (of course) the exact tool that I need, but it was at his shop. I didn't want to ask him to drive an hour round-trip to do this.

I'm grateful for my friends. After all, I'd be in a 3-wheeled Mustang without them!
