I thought it might be neat to share <a href="https://tuckbot.tv" target="_blank">Tuckbot.tv</a>'s monthly traffic stats - so here's August.

All of these stats come from Google Analytics. Due to how Tuckbot is typically used (in-app browser on mobile devices), the "new user" and "returning user" stats are not entirely accurate as many in-app browsers destroy cookies once closed. However, what we can see is a trend of overall users compared to July.

We can see that Tuckbot saw **221,091** total users in August, down 17.6% from July. Again, I question the accuracy due to in-app browsers, but overall we can see there were **323,035** total page views in August, which is 20.8% fewer than July.

There was a spike on August 4th. This is due to the tragic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosion" target="_blank">Beirut explosion</a> and massive influx of users submitting videos to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout" target="_blank">/r/PublicFreakout</a>.

Unsurprisingly for Tuckbot operating on an American website, most of the visitors last month - **90.8%**, in fact - spoke English. Or, at the very least, had English as their browser's language.

Also unsurprisingly is the location of Tuckbot's August visitors. As English was the most popular language, **72%** of visitors were from the Americas, with a much higher concentration in North America.

![Graph showing 169,471 visitors from mobile devices, 36,041 visitors from desktop devices, and 2,445 visitors from tablets.](/assets/2020-09-01-tuckbot-august-stats/img/tuckbot_4.png)

Lastly, and perhaps the most relevant statistic for a site whose content I do not control, comes the breakdown of visitor devices. It's no secret that mobile devices make up the majority of internet traffic now, and that trend stays true here: **76.4%** of Tuckbot traffic came from mobile devices in August, with desktop claiming **16.4%** and tablets barely **0.01%**.

I'd love to take Tuckbot for a redesign at some point with a mobile-first approach. I fear I've taken on more side projects than I have time to give though, so that will get added to the list while I give the others some love.
