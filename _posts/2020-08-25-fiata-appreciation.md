It has been a little while since I've truly stopped and appreciated the <abbr title="Fiat's Miata">Fiata</abbr>'s styling. I like it so much more than the Miata of the same generation.

Putting all of my, uh, _unique_ experiences with this car aside, Mazda truly built a wonderful little go-kart. It's quick (given its size and weight), extremely well balanced, and, thanks to <a href="https://good-win-racing.com" target="_blank">Good-Win Racing</a>, has a nasty little growl.

It's a bummer <a href="https://horsepowering.com" target="_blank">Hunt Valley Horsepower</a> has been cancelled most of this year due to <span class="nobreak">COVID-19</span>, but we all have to do our part. I always had a lot of fun driving this car up there on Saturday mornings as the rest of the world slept in.

Maybe I'll borrow my roommate's GoPro and make a driving video soon?
