<h3>Why I Code</h3>

When I was 12, I went to a computer summer camp that ultimately changed my life
forever: at the end of each day, and feeding my Star Wars obsession, we would
all play [Star Wars: Jedi Knight Jedi
Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Jedi_Academy). I
noticed some online servers had their own modifications to the world and
gameplay and had to know how. I ended up meeting the developer of one of those
modifications, [@RoboPhred](https://github.com/robophred/), who has become a
life-long friend and software development mentor. It turns out that **I like
knowing how stuff works**, and **I really like building stuff that others can
use**; from [Reddit video mirror
bots](https://github.com/kyleratti/tuckbot-downloader) and [Reddit mirror
directory services](https://github.com/kyleratti/a-centralized-mirror) for the
community, to [slideshow websites](https://github.com/kyleratti/ttu-slideshow)
and [file relay servers](https://github.com/kyleratti/tscw-daemon) for my
sister's work, and going back as far as high school, [Twitter
bots](https://github.com/kyleratti/ccpsalerts-old) that tweeted county school
closures and countdowns to last days of high school for classmates, I think it's
the coolest thing in the world to be able to build something, watch it come to
life, and see it used by others.
