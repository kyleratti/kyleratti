  <h3>Why I Code</h3>

  <p>
    When I was 12, a series of seemingly insignificant events led to a chance
    meeting that forever changed my life: I went to a summer camp where we
    played a Star Wars video game during down time, I obtained a
    <small>borderline</small> unhealthy obsession with the game, and started
    playing on random multiplayer servers outside of camp.
  </p>

  <p>
    Immediately, I noticed some servers in the game had their own modifications
    to the world and gameplay and had to know more about it. I ended up
    communicating with a modification developer named
    <a href="https://github.com/robophred" target="_blank">@RoboPhred</a> who
    took the time to teach me how to program my own modifications. He has since
    become a life-long friend and mentor!
  </p>

  <p>
    As it turns out, <b>I like knowing how stuff works</b> and
    <b>I <i>really</i> like building stuff that others can use.</b> From
    <a href="https://github.com/kyleratti/tuckbot-downloader" target="_blank"
      >video mirror bots</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/kyleratti/a-centralized-mirror" target="_blank"
      >mirror directory listing bots</a
    >
    for Reddit communities, to
    <a href="https://github.com/kyleratti/ttu-slideshow" target="_blank"
      >auto-updating slideshow websites
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/kyleratti/tscw-daemon" target="_blank">
      web-based file relay servers</a
    >
    for my sister's work, I think it's the coolest thing in the world to
    <b>be able to build something,</b> <b>watch it come to life,</b> and
    <b>see it used by others!</b>
